# SA2-Need-for-Speed
**Go fast, or the darkness will consume you.**
This is a C++ program which runs alongside Sonic Adventure 2 on PC. When stopped, the screen is completely dark. As you move, the screen gets brighter, and the faster you go, the brighter it gets.

If you can find some way to make this more fun, feel free to push it.

## Building
Just open "SA2 Need for Speed.sln" in Visual Studio and build as Release x86. 
You could probably build it in any Windows compiler.
